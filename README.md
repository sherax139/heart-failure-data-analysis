About the Project
Cardiovascular failure kills aboAn estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke. Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Blood often backs up and causes fluid to build up in the lungs (congest) and in the legs. The fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath and swelling of the legs and feet. In this report, we analyze a dataset containing the medical records of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad and the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology (Punjab - Pakistan) during the months of April to December in 2015. The graphical representation and visualisation of data using matplotlib and seaborn library in python helps us to easily understand a lot better about the dataset.
